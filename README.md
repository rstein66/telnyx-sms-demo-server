# SMS Demo Server

This demonstration presents three implementations of an SMS echo server
using Telnyx's SMS API. The first implementation uses the
[aiohttp](http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library; the second
uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/); and the third is built using the
standard library's [HTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html).

## Implementations

### aiohttp

This implementation is a straightforward variant of the server example
from the quick start guide
[here](http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html).

One POST route is added to the application and any blocking I/O
operations such as reading request body and sending a request are
handled asynchronously. (If you are not so familiar with asynchronous
programming, there are a number of helpful tutorials out there, such as
this [Asynchronous I/O Walkthrough](http://www.pgbovine.net/python-async-io-walkthrough.htm)).

### Flask

This is yet another straightforward implementation. The `echo()`
function is decorated with Flask's `@app.route` decorator. It only
accepts `POST` requests. The receive and echo functions in this case are
synchronous, i.e. blocking on I/O.

### HTTPServer

The python
[http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) is not
ideal for this application, for two reasons: (1) You can't easily pass
custom parameters, e.g. secret key, to the function that handles your
request. (2) You have to do all the manual parsing of the request and
en/decoding.

To solve the first problem, you need to wrap a factory function around
the class definition and return the class back to the invoking function,
as demonstrated in [`smsdemo/httpserver/handler.py`](smsdemo/httpserver/handler.py). For the second
problem, you just have to be careful with classic Unicode vs bytes
distinction.

## Running a demo server

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment (using
   [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)):
   ```shell
   user@sms-demo:~/sms-demo$ mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 sms-demo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   (sms-demo) user@sms-demo:~/sms-demo$ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install this package under your path:
   ```shell
   (sms-demo) user@sms-demo:~/sms-demo$ python setup.py install
   ```
5. Choose an implementation to run:
   ```
   (sms-demo) user@sms-demo:~/sms-demo$ ./bin/demoserver
   Usage: demoserver [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

     Run a sample SMS echo server. The server accepts Telnyx SMS webhook
     deliveries and sends an echo of the message back to the sender.

   Options:
     -h, --host TEXT     HTTP server IP.
     -p, --port INTEGER  HTTP server port.
     -s, --secret TEXT   Secret from your SMS messaging profile.  [required]
     --help              Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
     aiohttp  Run the aiohttp-based demo server.
     flask    Run the Flask-based demo server.
     http     Run the HTTPServer-based demo server.

   (sms-demo) user@sms-demo:~/sms-demo$ ./bin/demoserver -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8089 \
       -s MY-SUPER-SECRET-SECRET aiohttp
   ```

Please make sure that the `-s` parameter matches the message profile 
secret that is set for your messaging profile in the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/).

## Miscellaneous notes

1. We recommend setting up a python virtual environment while developing
   your application, so that your native environment is preserved. You
   can find more information about virtual environments
   [here](http://python-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).  
2. Please avoid hard coding your messaging profile secret for sending
   SMS in the production environment. If your secret is ever
   compromised, be sure to generate a new one through the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/).
3. There are of course many other options for implementing such servers,
   e.g. by using the [Twisted framework](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). We would love to expand these demo servers and would welcome any contributions.
